I love the cool &quot;arrowhead&quot; shape to this gem.\n\nThis faceted beer quartz &quot;arrowhead&quot; briolette is eye clean and full of amazing sparkle.  Beautifully cut, and a gorgeous whiskey shade.  \n\nThe gemstone measures 10 X 15mm at its widest and longest points.  I tucked it up inside a beautiful Bali sterling silver cone cap and then topped it with a tiny citrine gemstone rondelle.\n\nThis swings from quality, textured sterling silver chain.  Clasp is a sterling silver spring-lock clasp.  Near the clasp, I added two more citrine rondelles, wrapping them securely in sterling wire.\n\nChain length is just under 17.5&quot;, with the pendant dropping down an additional 1.25&quot;.\n\nGorgeous warmth and appeal to this minimalist pendant necklace.  I just love the sparkle and cut to this luxe stone!\n\nThanks for looking, and please see my shop for more quartz jewelry

Unfortunately, I cannot do that as it is a merchandise transaction between you and me.\r\n\r\nI am a speedy shipper.  If you pay via Paypal, your item will be shipped within 1-2 business days; that is, barring pestilence, famine, rising of the creek, or alien abduction. \r\n\r\nI like to use recycled materials for my packaging.  I do wrap carefully, but know that your box or bubble mailer may have been used before.

You can use this as a \u201ctester\u201d to be sure that your decal is applied just right.I\u2019m including some simple instructions below in the event that you haven\u2019t used vinyl before as it is a bit different than a standard sticker.\r\n\r\nStep 1\r\nClean the area thoroughly with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Do not use Windex or similar products because it will leave a residue behind that will prevent the sticker from adhering well.\r\n\r\nStep 2\r\nPrepare the sticker for application by firmly rubbing a squeegee or credit card across the \u201ctop\u201d transfer tape. This removes any air bubbles that may have formed and makes the sticker cling to the transfer tape.\r\n\r\nStep 3\r\nPeel the white paper \u201cback\u201d backing off the sticker. If the sticker clings to the backing, slowly replace the paper backing and repeat Step 2.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nSlowly lower the sticker onto the surface and rub it in place firmly with a squeegee or credit card. \r\n\r\nStep 5\r\nSlowly peel the \u201ctop\u201d clear transfer tape off at an angle.
