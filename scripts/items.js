Plus, the gun metal plating will give your pen a rich and luxurious look. Built for beauty and durability, this pen includes a balanced style and design.\n\nThis pen will make a special gift for Whiskey lovers. The pen blank was made from an authentic Jack Daniels charred Tiger Oak whiskey barrels used for aging Old No. 7 whiskey. The whiskey is aged in these barrels for 4 years.

The pen comes with its own certificate of authenticity. \n\nEach of our pens go through the process of cutting, turning, and sanding on the lathe, and are finished with a high quality friction polish that will keep them looking great for years.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nCustom Orders:\nIf you&#39;d like to order a variation of this pen with different wood or fittings, please request a custom order from our store.

"description": "Set of 3 laser engraved whiskey stones. The perfect addition to our groomsmen gift boxes and liquor flask sets. Whiskey stones are perfect for the connoisseur who enjoys their beverage with a slight chill, but doesn’t want to water down the perfect balance of flavors in their drink. Stones are laser engraved on a single side with your choice of personalization. Each set of 3 comes in it&#39;s very own muslin storage bag.\r\n\r\nUse to chill your whiskey, scotch, vodka, wine, etc.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for a set of three (3) laser engraved whiskey stones.\r\nStones are made from 100% pure Soapstone. Each stone measures 7/8”cubed.\r\n\r\nSoapstone has superior thermal mass giving it the natural ability to retain its’ temperature for extended periods of time. Soapstone is non-porous, odorless, and tasteless.  It will not absorb odors from your freezer like ice cubes do. Edges are rounded and soapstone is softer than glass so they will not damage barware. These stones are dishwasher safe and will never wear out.\r\n\r\nNeed a different quantity or a custom image or logo? I love custom orders ..\r\nJust send me a message and I&#39;ll get a RESERVED order set right up for you!",

You have the option to upgrade to either priority (2-3 day) or Express shipping (next day). These all have an upgrade cost so please message me ahead of time so I can quote you the rates.\r\nWe also DO NOT OFFER TRACKING unless asked before the item has been marked shipped. If you need a tracking number please let us know when you make your purchase.\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t give any &quot;guarantee delivery date&quot; because a lot of things can effect shipping times. Weather, holidays, ext. We however will do our best to get your package to you as soon as possible.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nWe ship USPS airmail This is USUALLY 10-14 business days with no tracking. HOWEVER depending on your countries customs regulations they can take up to 3 MONTHS. We are in no way liable for items that are held up in customs, I&#39;m sorry it is a risk we all take when we order overseas. We can upgrade your shipping to Priority (6-10day with tracking) but once again These times can&#39;t be guaranteed with orders being held up in customs.\r\nIf you would like to upgrade your parcel to Priority you must let us know before the item has been marked shipped, and the parcel won&#39;t be shipped out until the shipping upgrade has been purchased.\r\n\r\n\r\nCustoms Fee and Charges:\r\nFor international orders, the shipping charges ONLY cover the cost of postage and not any customs fees, charges, or duties that may need to be paid. Please be aware of the customs regulations for your country prior to purchase, and contact the shops prior to purchase to ensure a smooth shipping experience.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLOST/DELAYED PACKAGES:\r\nWe are not responsible for delayed/lost packages, purely because the cause of the delay is completely out of our control. We will work with you the best that we can to figure out a solution for the problem, but we won&#39;t refund item/shipping for delayed packages. A way around this is tracking, it lets both of us see where the packages have been and get them to you faster if there is an issue. We don&#39;t automatically offer tracking but if it is shipped within the USA we can add it on for free, just let us know before the item is marked shipped. For tracking on International orders you must upgrade to Priority shipping.\r\n\r\nIf you think your package is lost please contact us, this is an incredibly rare occurance, but we will work with you the best way we can to figure out a solution.\r\n\r\n*********Once again International buyers please keep in mind our packages usually get to you in 14 business days but they can be delayed by as much as 3 months depending on if they are held up in customs!***********************\r\n\r\nAgain if you have any questions or concerns contact us!",
"policy_refunds": "Return Policies are as follows:\r\n\r\n-No returns on any stickers, Vinyl Decals, or bumper stickers\r\n-Returns are accepted on glassware (excluding custom items, limited edition sets,clearance and upcycled products) 5 business days after item was received (or 7 days after item was purchased, whichever is longer). items MUST be in original condition to receive money back. Buyer pays return shipping. Once item has been received a refund will be authorized.\r\n-Clearance and upcycled products, and Limited edition sets are all final sale.\r\n-All custom orders, orders with added messages, names are all final sale\r\n\r\nIf you receive a damaged item all we require is a picture of the damaged glass. This must be provided no longer then 24 hours after the order has been received. Pictures of the packaging may also be required. We won&#39;t ask you to waste your time shipping it back to us, a picture works great and we will get you a replacement glass shipped out within 3 business days.\r\n",
"policy_additional": "Absolutely every glass we make to order. this takes at least 3-5 days for us to cut our stencils, affix them, sandblast, clean polish and pack. We do all of this Mondays-Saturdays (we take Sunday&#39;s off) so it usually takes a week until we ship out your glass. If you need the glass sooner, the best way is to contact us before you place your order, and we will make sure to do is ASAP.However if you place your order, and don&#39;t notify that you might need it by a certain timeframe it can take up to a week to ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tend to recycle boxes we feel would be suitable/strong enough to ship to you. So sometimes you might get a straight cardboard box,or maybe something else a little more primitive. If you would prefer a standard cardboard box please feel free to ask and we will be happy to oblige.\r\n",

"description": "This is a soap/lotion dispenser of the top selling Canadian whisky in the U.S.\n\nHere is a recycled/re-purposed Crown Roayl 750ml bottle outfitted with an all-metal soap/lotion pump that is perfect for your kitchen, bathroom, bar or laundry room.  The dispenser fits perfectly on the bottle.  The tube length has been cut to fit this bottle (omitted from the photographs to show the details of the glass.)  The pump head has a stainless steel internal spring and glass ball for durability.\n\nThe complete assembly measures 9 11/16&quot; x 3&quot; x 5 5/8&quot; (24.6cm x 7.6cm x 14.3cm)\n\nPlease note:  This listing is for the bottle and one metal soap dispenser in your choice of finishes.  Please select from one of the pump heads in the last photograph:\n\n1.  Stainless steel\n2.  Satin Copper\n3.  Chrome\n\nAlso, please select whether &quot;With&quot; or &quot;Without Label&quot; as I have one of each.\n\nSoap/lotion/body wash not included.\n\nMy stock of bottles is constantly rotating.  Please contact me if you would like multiples of this item (who doesn&#39;t have lotion, dish soap, hand soap and body wash around, right?)  I&#39;ll keep an eye out for others and let you know when I have additional bottles.\n\nPlease be sure to check out my other Doodads (many of which include re-purposing bottles into Porch Torches, patio and pendant lights.)  I have reduced shipping as much as possible when you order multiple items.\n\nThanks for looking at my stuff!\n\nOther unique items can be found at: https://www.etsy.com/shop/davesdoodads\n\nThe unique re-purposed items sold by Dave&#39;s Doodads are not sponsored or endorsed by the brewers/distillers/wineries/meaderies/cideries.  I do this out of love.",

In fine print on the bottom is: &quot;Bureau Engraving & Printing&quot;, &quot;$100 Dollars Per Year&quot; near the bottom, and &quot;Stamp For Special Tax&quot;, near the top, When held to the light the watermark, USIR, is visible.\n\nThe front measures 8&quot; by 7&quot;, the coupons are folded behind, so actual length is 14&quot;. The document has only one hole punch (to void), two tack holes, a few small, light spots and light edge wear, otherwise, condition is excellent...a beautiful document...great in person!\n\nThis is a FANTASTIC piece of history and would be wonderful to display in a pharmacy, doctor&#39;s office, museum, bar or office! I am happy to answer any questions, please feel free to email and thank you for your interest!",

"title": "Irish beard balm Whiskey barrel  1 ounce tin",
"description": "Irish beard balm is a special blend of Coconut oil, Sweet almond oil, Jojoba oil, Argan oil, Hemp oil, and Bees wax.\n\nAll products that go into Irish beard balm are made with natural ingredients that are GMO free.  I use no chemicals or preservatives in my product. To see my organic certifications please go to https://www.irishbeardbalm.com/products.html\n\nYou may have noticed that unlike every other beard balm on the market, I do not use coco or shea butter. These butters are normally used to thicken balms but they also leave your beard feeling heavy and they can build up over time. After extensive trial and error, I found a way to make a balm that does not use any butters which leaves my beard feeling light.\n\nAs you can see, the price of this particular balm is quite higher than the others, this is because of the higher cost of the fragrance that I use to make Whiskey Barrel. Unlike my other balm fragrances that utilize an essential oil, this balm uses a much thicker much more potent essential oil paste. This fragrance is definitely much stronger than the others and it last longer through the day. Whiskey barrel, like it&#39;s name implies, has a strong earthy, woody scent. Having smelled the inside of a spent oak whiskey barrel, I can say that is what this smell like. \n\nPlease check out my other listings. I carry a full line of mens combs, ladies brushes, beard oil and an all natural lip balm.\n\nRemember as with any new product, test on a small insensitive part of your body to gauge for any adverse reactions.",

PLEASE NOTE that ALL CARRIERS REQUIRE photographs of the packing material AND the damage items, SHOWING PERSONALIZATION, where applicable.  Work or replacement items cannot begin until we have required photographs.\r\n\r\nOAK BARREL INFO:\r\n\r\nThere are lots of oak barrel makers out there (with lots of different theories and practices) and there is lots of info on the Web. We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete):\r\n\r\n• As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking.\r\n• In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung/cork. \r\n• To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. \r\n• Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry.\r\n• Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. \r\n• Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. \r\n• As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. \r\n• You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. \r\n• Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. \r\n• If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. \r\n• For your safety, if using chemicals to clean/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper use.\r\n• The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks.  Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39;  Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process!\r\n\r\nAngel’s Share.\r\nAngel’s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher “angel’s share”, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot;\r\n\r\nStoring your Empty Barrel After Initial Use \r\nIdeally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55° – 60°) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers’ guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. \r\n\r\n",

"title": "The Dylan Tee - Unisex - PRE ORDER",
"description": "This baby is part of our Music Muse series, inspired by musicians and bands who fill our hearts and lives with tunes that move us.  This series will constantly be growing as time goes on...\n\n\nABOUT THE SHIRT:\nPrinted on super soft heathered tees, they are perfect for lounging around the house all day, or outfitting with your favorite flannel and skirt for a day out.  In our minds, a good tee is the perfect base for any outfit.\n\nThe fit of these runs about a size small in the women&#39;s style, so size up if you don&#39;t want it to fit you too tight.  If your unsure, grab your favorite fitting tee and compare the measurements with the size chart below.  Weve included both the women&#39;s and unisex for size comparisons.  The biggest difference in style between these is that the women&#39;s neckline scoops a bit lower and they are more fitted, where as the unisex ones are a bit longer, more boxy and have a higher neckline (and of course are more true to men&#39;s sizing).  But they both are made from super soft heathered material that just feels so good on!  All inks used are eco-friendly water based inks.\n\n**Size note: Model is wearing the women&#39;s size medium, and is 5&#39;2&quot; and 115 lbs.**\n**Material is: Tri-Blend (50% Polyester / 25% Ring-Spun Cotton / 25% Rayon) **\n**Color is heather tri-coffee (sort of a light brown)**\n\n\nSHIPPING DATES // PLEASE READ:\n\nMost of our shirts are PRE-ORDER only, meaning they are not ready to ship.  They take 6-7 weeks before they are shipped off to you, although we do strive to send them out quicker if we can.  You can always refer to your invoice to see when your estimated shipping date is.  Although we do try out best to get them out quicker we cannot guarantee it.  Please only order if you are okay with this wait.\n\n**A little extra info explaining the pre-order time length: Skyline Fever is currently our second job.  James works a full-time day job, while Laura runs her own full-time business.  We hope that one day we can call Skyline Fever James full time job, so every pre-order gets us one step closer to being able to provide quicker turn around times!  Until then, we will do our best to get out each order as quickly as possible while creating them during our evenings and weekends.  We really can&#39;t thank everyone enough for always being so patient and loving our work enough to wait that long, it means the world to us!**\n\n\nSIZE CHART:\nWomen&#39;s Small //  Size 0-2 // Chest Width 16-7/8&quot; // Front Body Length 25-7/8&quot;\nWomen&#39;s Medium //  Size 4-6 // Chest Width 17-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 26-1/2&quot;\nWomen&#39;s Large // Size 8-10 // Chest Width 17-7/8&quot; // Front Body Length 27-1/8&quot;\nWomen&#39;s XL // Size 12-14 // Chest Width 18-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 27-3/4&quot;\n\nUnisex Extra Small // Chest Width 15-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 27-3/4&quot;\nUnisex Small // Chest Width 17-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 28-3/4&quot;\nUnisex Medium // Chest Width 19-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 29-3/4&quot;\nUnisex Large // Chest Width 21-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 30-3/4&quot;\nUnisex XL // Chest Width 23-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 31-3/4&quot;\nUnisex 2XL // Chest Width 25-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 32-3/4&quot;\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT: Please note that all of our designs are copyrighted and my not in any way be recreated.",

"description": "Whiskey Stones are a Unique and Popular gift on their own, but when they are personalized they become extra special.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for a set of 6 Engraved Whiskey Stones in a personalized wood box.  This makes a great gift for Weddings, Christmas, Stocking Fillers, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Military Weddings, Whiskey Stones are always are well received gift.\r\n\r\nEach Whiskey Stone measures 1&quot; x 1&quot; and is made of 100% Soapstone right here in the USA. Only 2 or 3  are needed per drink.  Each set comes in it&#39;s own Muslin Storage bag with an instructions for use card.  \r\n\r\n**You can choose between 2 colors for the Gift Box, Jacobean (Rustic Brown) or Ebony**\r\n\r\nThis gift set is fully customizable so I can engrave anything on the Stones and Box, just send me your engraving instructions in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; section at check out or send me an Etsy Convo.\r\nSome font examples can be seen in the item pictures.  \r\n\r\n**What are Whiskey Stones?**\r\n\r\nWhiskey Stones, are a new way to chill your whiskey or wine without diluting your drink. Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\r\n\r\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\r\n\r\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

I add new items weekly so please Favorite my shop so you are the first to see the new arrivals.\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/TheUltimateManShop",

Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",
"policy_refunds": "We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping).  Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",
"policy_additional": "FAQs - \r\n\r\nDo you have any coupon codes for discounts?  \r\n\r\nYes we do, right now there is a 10% of everything Spring sale, simply use the coupon code SPRINGSALE10 at checkout. (Valid February 28th 2015 - May 31st 2015).\r\n\r\nThere is also a free shipping code for any orders over $150, the code to enter is SHIP2MEFORFREE.\r\n\r\n(Only 1 code can be applied per order). \r\n\r\nHow long will it take for my order to be dispatched?\r\n\r\nWe know you would like your order to arrive ASAP and we want to get it to you fast.  Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

"title": "Cobalt Wooden Ring Lined with Whiskey Barrel White Oak Barrel",
"description": "The inner liner of this Cobalt ring is made from a genuine used Jack Daniels Whiskey white oak barrel. Almost as much work goes into perfecting a bourbon barrel as does perfecting the iconic American whiskey. Carefully selected American White Oak is slowly dried outdoors for nearly a year. After being exposed to the rain and sun, it is kiln dried, assembled, and then charred to release the naturally occurring flavors that will be imparted to the whiskey. Though the blanks reek of whiskey, the final products (sadly, from an authenticity perspective) have no odor, having been sealed with finish.\n\nI have a few other barrel wood options besides Jack Daniels®, including Jim Beam, Maker&#39;s Mark, and Buffalo Trace. For this ring, I would be willing to use the rare stock I have from The Macallan.  Please see this blog post to see what I mean:\n\nhttp://www.wedgewoodrings.com/blog/2014/4/27/barrel-staves-and-the-many-options-at-our-disposal\n\nJACK DANIEL&#39;S is a registered trademark and is not involved in or affiliated with the production or distribution of this product!\n\n\nThe outer portion of this ring is made of Cobalt - the most scratch resistant and shatterproof material I offer.  Like titanium it is hypoallergenic and biocompatible.  However, in many circumstances under which your Titanium ring might scratch, Cobalt will not.   It is an alloy that is identical to Platinum in color, but it is an order of magnitude stronger.  Cobalt offers nearly the scratch resistance of Tungsten Carbide, but unlike Tungsten, Cobalt will not shatter if dropped. \n\nThe ring pictured is a satin finish, but a polished finishes is also available. The ring is also a domed profile (vs. a flat profile), which can also be changed. Just add the details you like in the &quot;message to seller&quot; section at checkout. \n\nThis is the first Cobalt ring with a wood interior ever offered.\n\nI highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size. &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order.\n\n+++SEE SHOP ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE SHOP PAGE FOR CURRENT SHIP DATE+++\n\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\n\nThe minimum width for this style is 5mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\n\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\n\nSize 5- 5mm\nSize 6- 5.5mm\nSize 7- 6mm\nSize 8- 6.5mm\nSize 9- 7mm\nSize 10- 7.5mm\nSize 11+ - 8mm\n\n\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nCobalt lined wood rings can be adjusted up or down about 1/4 size (by removing or adding finish to the interior). Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. REFUNDS AND EXCHANGES WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE. BE 100% SURE OF YOUR ACCURATE AND CORRECT SIZE BEFORE ORDERING.\n\nPlease click on the &quot;Policies&quot; link (under Shop Info) to see wood ring care instructions and FAQ.\n\nEach ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. This protective coating is sanded up to 12,000 grit for an unbelievable, glass-like finish.\n\nAll rings ship via USPS Priority (or Priority International) Small Flat Rate Box. If you are outside the US and Canada, your shipping option is Global Express by default.  Please read below for details.  Insurance is mandatory for this ring, and included in the shipping charge. You pay what I pay for shipping, nothing more.\n\nFor customers outside the US:\n\nDue to changes in USPS policy, international packages sent to countries other than Canada can no longer be tracked past the US border.  Insurance claims are also not possible.  Due to this change and for your protection, international customers outside of Canada will be required to pay for USPS Global Express shipping ($44.95), which in addition to guaranteeing arrival within 3-5 business days (excepting intervention from your country’s customs department), also can be tracked and insured.  I wish I could offer a more economical solution, but cheaper options are too risky.\n\nInternational customers are responsible for all fees associated with shipping to their respective countries. Orders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond the original delivery estimates. It is against the law and I will not mark an item as a &quot;gift&quot; to avoid any fees.",

Insurance claims are also not possible.  Due to this change and for your protection, international customers outside of Canada will be required to pay for USPS Global Express shipping, which in addition to guaranteeing arrival within 3-5 business days (excepting intervention from your country’s customs department), also can be tracked and insured.  I wish I could offer a more economical solution, but cheaper options are too risky.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nWe love the simplicity and beauty of natural wood rings.

"sale_message": "Below are some very important policies that I hope will not be relevant to your order (because they are only relevant when something is wrong). PLEASE READ THEM in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING RETURNS: Every ring is made to order, to the exact size you provide to me.  Rings with a wood interior can be adjusted up or down by about 1/4 size, but beyond that YOUR RING CANNOT BE RESIZED.  Refunds and exchanges will not be possible, as an entirely new ring will have to be made for you.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING MODIFICATIONS: When I receive an order, even though the ship date seems far off (in practice, I often ship early), work begins on your ring immediately.  Within 48 hours, the metal for your ring has very likely already been ordered, and perhaps has already been completed. For this reason, if you need to make a change (size, width, etc.) AFTER 48 hours, there will be a charge of $30.  \r\n\r\nThank you for reading.  This is obviously an automatically generated message.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me through Etsy.  I respond fairly quickly.  If you find these policies overly draconian or otherwise problematic, please contact me as soon as possible so I can, with regret, cancel your order.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSteven Wyatt\r\nWedgeWood Rings",

"policy_shipping": "Each ring is custom made. Only 45 custom Titanium orders are accepted each month.  Typical lead time is 4 weeks.  The current ship date for my rings is always available at the top of my shop in the announcements section. Rush order for Ti rings (15- day turnaround) is available for purchase as well.\r\n\r\nIf you have a specific date by which you need the rings, please email us first to see if this is possible. We will make every effort to get it to you in time!\r\n\r\nAll rings will be shipped domestically via USPS priority mail or priority international.  There are optional express shipping listings as well.  You pay what I pay for shipping, and no more.\r\n\r\nFor customers outside the US:\r\nInternational customers are responsible for all fees associated with shipping to their respective countries. Orders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond the original delivery estimates. It is against the law and I will not mark an item as a &quot;gift&quot; to avoid any fees.",
"policy_refunds": "You must provide me with an accurate size. The size you order will be the size you receive.  NO REFUNDS OR EXCHANGES WILL BE POSSIBLE IF YOU PROVIDE ME WITH THE WRONG SIZE.\r\n\r\nIf you order a ring with a wooden inner surface, and it turns out to be a little too big, I can decrease the size slightly.  If i is much too big, or if it is too small no refunds or exchanges will be offered, as a re-size is not possible, and it takes just as much material and time to provide a new ring.\r\n\r\nThe owner is responsible for maintaining the finish. This means scratches on the finish or loss of the glossy finish (issues that can be fixed and prevented with buffing wax) are not covered.  Rings are covered against breaks due to craftsmanship for 6 months - I will replace it for no charge.  If, however, your ring meets a bad end due to an accident (smashing in a door, or any other stresses that no wooden ring could expect to withstand), no refund will be offered. ",
"policy_additional": "**FAQ**\r\n\r\nWhy wooden rings?\r\n\r\n*Plain metal is boring.\r\n\r\n*Nickel allergies are quite common, and wooden rings are a great alternative. The titanium I use is also nickel-free and hypoallergenic.\r\n\r\n*They are beautiful, and no two are the same.\r\n\r\n*They make great gifts – especially for first wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is paper [close enough]) and 5th wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is WOOD)\r\n\r\nHow durable are your rings?\r\n\r\nThe most important factor that determines the durability of these rings is the owner. Each ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. As for the normal wear-and-tear from daily use, the perfect gloss will eventually become scratched (just as with metal rings), but buffing wax occasionally applied will protect the ring and its shine for years.\r\n\r\nThe titanium lined rings are unquestionably significantly stronger than rings made of wood alone. On the Moh’s Hardness Scale, Gold and Silver are around 3, Platinum 4.5, and Titanium is 6.  Any circumstances under which your Titanium is scratched, any precious metal would have been scratched all that more severely.  It is certainly not going to snap.\r\n\r\nPlease use common sense when wearing a ring with a wooden component.  WedgeWood Rings the strongest and most durable wood rings you can buy, but it is still a thin piece of wood you are wearing on your finger.  If you are going to move furniture, take it off first; if you are going to go climbing, do not wear your ring; if you are going to do some landscaping and are moving some rough stones, pocket the ring.\r\n\r\n“Hybrid Epoxy Finish”\r\n\r\nPart shameless marketing term, part description of a secret, painstakingly  brewed combination of epoxy and other finishes, this phrase describes the primary protection for the wood in your ring.  Think boat finish, thats pretty close to the meat of it.  The actual details I wouldnt tell my own mother (sorry mom!).\r\n\r\nSee this post for some more details: http://wedgewoodrings.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/the-promised-big-announcement/\r\n\r\nWhat size am I?\r\n\r\nTitanium ring sizes run from 4 to 16 including quarter sizes. I highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size. &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order. Keep a couple things in mind: your fingers are slightly swollen in the morning (don’t ask me why), your fingers are larger during warm weather, your fingers are larger after a meal (especially salty meals). This means that if you have your finger measured on a chilly evening before dinner, the result will be on the low end of your actual size.\r\n\r\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\r\n\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nTitanium lined wood rings cannot be resized at all! Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. Refunds and exchanges will not be possible.\r\n\r\n~~~HOW DO I CARE FOR MY RING?~~~\r\n\r\nWater is no problem, sweat is no problem. Soap, occasional Purell, no problem!  If you work in a medical field, or any other profession that necessitates that your hands come in regular contact with strong solvents, I do NOT recommend you wear your ring while engaging in these activities.  No wood finish can withstand constant contact with solvents!  \r\n\r\nYour ring maintains its protection against water and soap only as long as the finish remains!  If you damage the finish, you must contact me for refinishing, or your ring may be permanently damaged.\r\n\r\nIn terms of maintaining the beauty of the finish, you can apply wax to the wood portions with a cloth. I personally use a suspension of hard and soft waxes in mineral oil (commercially available as butcher block conditioner) because the oil carries the waxes into any scratches that may be present and makes them invisible. It is also the first line of defense against anything harmful to the finish (including the friction with your finger). If you wanted to be extremely conscientious, you could apply it very often, like every few days or so. This sounds insane (and it is not really necessary), but it is literally the work of 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nWill my ring look just like the picture?\r\n\r\nEach ring is made to order and unique. The appearance will therefore vary according to the individual characteristics of the piece of wood. However, you can be assured that each ring is made to exacting standards of beauty and durability.\r\n\r\nCan I customize my ring?\r\n\r\nThe most common customization requests are width and profile modifications.\r\n\r\nWIDTH: I strive for “normal” proportions. I know that is unhelpful, so here is a rough guide: \r\n\r\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\r\n\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD EXTERIOR style is 4mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD INTERIOR style is 5mm. The maximum is 8mm.\r\n\r\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\r\n\r\nSize 5- 5mm\r\nSize 6 - 5.5mm\r\nSize 7- 6mm\r\nSize 8 - 6.5mm\r\nSize 9- 7mm\r\nSize 10 - 7.5mm\r\nSize 11+- 8mm\r\n\r\nPROFILE: By default, my rings have a lightly sloping dome shape– a traditional ring profile. Some people prefer a flat profile, and that is no problem. Just put your profile requests in the &quot;note to wedgewoodrings&quot; section at checkout.\r\n\r\nEngraving?\r\n\r\nI do not offer engraving for my rings. For the wood exterior rings you can get it engraved, however I do not recommend it. A jeweler can engrave titanium, but I do not know what clamping methods they might use. Because the vast majority of jewelers will be unfamiliar with wood and wood finish, they might damage it. Such damage would absolutely not be covered by warranty.\r\n\r\nWhere do you get your wood?\r\n\r\nExotic wood dealers on Ebay mainly. In some cases, I use found wood. I’ve even been known to raid roadside piles of cutoffs.\r\n\r\nCan you do custom orders using [insert wood/ wood combination here]?\r\n\r\nI certainly can if I have the wood. If I don’t have the wood, I may be able to get it. Send me an email with what you have in mind.\r\n\r\nSome examples of previous orders: ring made from the wood of an old house, ring made with sand from the honeymooners’ beach; ring made from a skateboard; ring made from a tree on the family farm.",
